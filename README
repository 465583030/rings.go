# Rings.go

rings.go was developed for a homework assignment to pass an mpi message around a ring 10 times.

This is not intended to give away any answers or idea, just an implementation of the above problem in Golang.

##INSTALL

To use rings.go, you must have a working installation of the Go tools. 

You can then use:
	go get [Need to update]
